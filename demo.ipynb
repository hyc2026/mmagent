      "The question asks for the total number of dance performances in the video. The provided knowledge includes descriptions of various clips, many of which feature dance performances. However, the knowledge does not explicitly state the total number of dance performances across all clips. While some clips clearly describe dance performances, others may contain additional performances that are not explicitly counted or described in the retrieved memories. To answer the question, we need to ensure that all clips containing dance performances are accounted for and that the total number is calculated.\n",
